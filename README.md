## What is Git?

Git is the version control technology that allows us to keep track of our projects as it develops.  With git, we can update our projects and view previous versions of the project.  Git also allows collaboration, where a project can be worked on by multiple people at the same time.

Github is a code-hosting platform where coding projects can be stored, edited, and managed using git.  Github is the place to host your projects, and to join in on open-source projects.  There are also plenty of public code repositories where you can view others' code.  It has become synonymous with git itself.

Using github in a situation where you're the only contributor is a good deal easier than in a group, and you're likely already familiar with using github with your own projects.  Let's quickly look over the basics of how git works.
